        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What is a climate change vulnerability assessment?</h2>

        <p>The natural and farmed environment is increasingly suffering the effects of climate change.</p>
        <p>This poses risks to:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>farming and forestry</li>
          <li>wildlife</li>
          <li>soils</li>
          <li>water resources</li>
          <li>natural carbon stores</li>
          <li>public access and recreation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All parts of the country could be affected by climate change. These effects will vary depending on where your land is, which habitats or features are on it, and how you use it.</p>
        <p>A climate vulnerability assessment is an approach that helps you decide how you respond to this.</p>
        <p>A climate change vulnerability assessment will help you to:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>understand which features of your land and business are vulnerable to climate change</li>
          <li>identify how they are under threat</li>
          <li>decide on the right actions to reduce these risks, and to take advantage of any new opportunities climate change may bring</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Vulnerability assessments can be complicated and take a long time. You can ask a land agent or expert to help you.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">The benefits of carrying out a climate change vulnerability assessment</h2>

        <p>Your assessment will help you to make decisions about how to manage your land in response to climate change. It will help you to:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>identify which environmental features and land uses are most vulnerable to the effects of climate change</li>
          <li>identify actions to manage these effects</li>
          <li>provide a framework for prioritising these actions</li>
          <li>identify any new opportunities that climate change may bring</li>
          <li>give you a baseline to compare any future change</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Dumped rubbish can:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>cause damage to sites</li>
          <li>prevent access to sites for scientitic and educational study</li>
          <li>prevent use of sites for recreation, like caving or potholing</li>
          <li>pollute land and water</li>
          <li>harm wildlife</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You can carry out a vulnerability assessment at any time, but the best time will be while developing your Environmental Land Management (ELM) application. You can then consider:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>the likely effects of climate change</li>
          <li>any actions you should take as a result</li>
          <li>which success criteria to use</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Prepare for your climate change vulnerability assessment</h2>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Step 1 - identify the features and management activities on your land</h3>

        <p>Start by identifying the important environmental features on your land. Include those that already exist, plus any that you want to create. These could include:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>habitats like woodland or grassland</li>
          <li>prominent landscape features</li>
          <li>species of conservation interest like turtle dove and tree sparrow</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Also, identify your current land uses and management activities, and potential future land uses if these are likely to change.</p>
        <p>Find out which habitats, features and designations are on your land and in the surrounding area. You can also look for features that used to be on your land, like historic boundaries.</p>
        <p>National Character Area (NCA) profiles can show you typical natural and cultural features in your local area.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Step 2 - consider what the future climate might look like</h3>

        <p>The Met Office has the most up-to-date climate change projections. These should help you to understand what climatic changes you can expect in your area.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Step 3 - consider how these changes will affect your land</h3>

        <p>You can now start to think about how climate change might affect your own land.</p>
        <p>There are several sources of information to help you do this.  Each NCA profile covers the effects of local climate change within its ‘Drivers of change’ section. You can find general information on the effects of climate change for:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>agriculture and forestry</li>
          <li>biodiversity</li>
          <li>water</li>
          <li>specific habitats and species</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You will also need to identify more local sources of information. These could include:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>county Wildlife Trust surveys</li>
          <li>Environment Agency reports</li>
          <li>your local authority documents</li>
          <li>local parish council information</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">How to carry out your climate change vulnerability assessment</h2>

        <p>Use the information you’ve gathered to assess the likely vulnerability of the important features you’ve identified on your land.</p>
        <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
          <li>Draw up a table and list all the key features on your land.  You may group similar habitats or species together.</li>
          <li>Give each feature a score of high, medium or low for:</li>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>changes in temperature</li>
            <li>changes in rainfall</li>
            <li>increased frequency and unpredictability of extreme events</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Consider these three scores in combination and give them a cumulative score</li>
          <li>Record the confidence you have in the assessment for each feature, based on the available information and your own judgement</li>
          <li>Use the assessment to prioritise your action</li>
        </ol>

        <!-- <p>For example, you might score your woodland as:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>medium for changes in temperature because the tree species on my land are only moderately sensitive to high temperatures and are mostly on north facing, shaded hillsides</li>
          <li>low for changes in rainfall because… (my woodland is on fairly heavy soil which is unlikely to dry out)</li>
          <li>low for extreme events because…(it is well established, mature woodland which has survived previous periods of heavy rainfall and high winds without damage),and</li>
          <li>low in combination because</li>
        </ul> -->
