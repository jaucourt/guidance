        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Sites of special scientific interest (SSSIs), and local geological sites, below the ground</h2>

        <p>Geological <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/protected-areas-sites-of-special-scientific-interest">SSSIs</a> and local geological sites are protected.</p>

        <p>Below-ground geological features that make up these sites can include:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>caves</li>
          <li>gorges and sinkholes leading to caves</li>
          <li>buried minerals, sediments and fossils</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These features can appear on any land where quarries, mines or cave systems exist, but caves are more common in limestone areas.</p>
        <p>If you’re not sure whether you have a protected site on your land, search for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/check-your-business-protected-area">protected areas of countryside</a>.

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Dumped rubbish</h2>

        <p>Dumped rubbish means modern materials, like:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>disused farm machinery</li>
          <li>plastic waste</li>
          <li>building rubble</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Dumped rubbish can:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>cause damage to sites</li>
          <li>prevent access to sites for scientitic and educational study</li>
          <li>prevent use of sites for recreation, like caving or potholing</li>
          <li>pollute land and water</li>
          <li>harm wildlife</li>
        </ul>


        <p>You must not remove items that have archaeological or geological value. For example, sinkholes can contain remains of ancient human activity, like animal bones. [inset text]</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Before you remove dumped rubbish</h2>    

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Get a survey of the site's geology</h3>

        <p>You’ll need to get a geological survey of the site. The survey will advise you on the safest way to clear the rubbish.</p>
        <p>If you need to remove rubbish from underground you’ll also need a geotechnical survey. This is to make sure the structure of the site is safe.</p>
        <p>The surveyor will tell you if you need further, specialist advice from, for example:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>bat conservationists</li>
          <li>archaeologists</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To arrange a survey, contact .....</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Get a wildlife survey</h3>

        <p>You’ll need to get a wildlife survey to find out if there are protected species using the feature. You’ll need a licensed surveyor to do this.</p>

        <p>Protected species include:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/bats-protection-surveys-and-licences">bats</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/badgers-survey-or-research-licence">badgers</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/wild-birds-protection-surveys-and-licences">birds</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>The surveyor will visit at a time when species will be present. For example, breeding bats are found in summer, while hibernating bats are found in winter.</p>

        <p>If there are protected species present, you’ll need a licence before you start the work.</p>


        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Check who you need to tell</h3>

        <p>If the rubbish is on an SSSI you must tell Natural England. You can contact Natural England by email: ProtectedSites@naturalengland.org.uk</p>

        <p>If the site is on or near a scheduled monument you must tell Historic England before you remove the rubbish.</p>

        <div class="govuk-warning-text">
          <span class="govuk-warning-text__icon" aria-hidden="true">!</span>
          <strong class="govuk-warning-text__text">
            <span class="govuk-warning-text__assistive">Warning</span>
          You could get a fine or go to prison if you damage a protected site or monument.</strong>
        </div>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">How to remove dumped rubbish</h2>

        <p>Follow the advice given in the geological survey</p>
        <p>You can use a licensed contractor to clear dumped rubbish from the entrance of a cave or feature, but you might need a specialist contractor for underground work.</p>
        <p>Caves might need to be cleared by hand and material removed in small quantities to a skip or vehicle a safe distance from the feature.</p>
        <p>Avoid using heavy machinery on buried sites, as wheels can compact or churn up the ground, causing damage.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Hazardous waste</h3>

        <p>Dumped rubbish can contain toxic or dangerous material, for example asbestos waste or chemicals. Check before you remove it.</p>

        <p>You’ll need a specialist licensed contractor to remove and dispose of hazardous waste.</p>

        <p>For more information contact the Environment Agency</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">When to do the work</h3>

        <p>Follow the advice given in the wildlife survey</p>
        <p>Underground sites can flood quickly. Check if rainfall would make it unsafe and do the work in dry weather.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">What it looks like when it's done</h3>

        <p>The geological survey will tell you what the site looks like</p>
